# Agriculture Helper Web Application

## Overview

Welcome to the Agriculture Helper web application repository! This Flask-based application is designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in the field of agriculture. With a focus on three key features, disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, fertilizer recommendation, and crop recommendation based on soil compositions, this application aims to empower farmers with technology-driven solutions to improve their crop yields and overall agricultural practices.

## Features

### 1. Disease Detection using CNN Models

One of the critical challenges in agriculture is the timely identification of plant diseases. Our application utilizes state-of-the-art CNN models trained on extensive datasets to identify diseases in plants accurately. Farmers can simply upload images of their plants, and the application will analyze them to detect any signs of diseases. Early detection can help farmers take proactive measures to prevent the spread of diseases and minimize crop loss.

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendation

Proper fertilization is essential for optimizing crop growth and yield. Our application provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on the type of crop and soil conditions. By inputting information about the soil's nutrient levels and the target crop, farmers can receive customized fertilizer recommendations to ensure that their crops receive the right nutrients, leading to healthier and more productive plants.

### 3. Crop Recommendation based on Soil Compositions

Choosing the right crop to cultivate is a crucial decision for farmers. Our application offers crop recommendations based on the analysis of soil compositions. Farmers can input details about their soil, such as pH levels, nutrient content, and moisture levels. The application's algorithm will then suggest suitable crops that are likely to thrive in those specific soil conditions, helping farmers make informed planting decisions.
